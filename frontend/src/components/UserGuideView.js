        <p><strong>Disease Model</strong></p>
        <p>The current implementation, Stochastic SEATIRD, was adapted from a previous code base. The main entrypoint to this disease model is a method called <strong>simulate()</strong>, which is called for each day, for each node, from <strong>src/simulator.py</strong>. This method models the progression of individuals through different stages of disease, including susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, treatable, infectious, recovered, and deceased. The output of the method is the updated state of the population, including the number of individuals in each disease stage for each age group, risk group, and vaccination status, at the end of the simulation period.</p>
        <p>The main logic of the method is to work through an <i>“event queue” </i> associated with each node. Events are either <i>transitions</i> from one compartment to another (e.g. I => R), or contacts. The event queue is initialized by the user-input initial infected, then it continues to take on new events through the course of simulation.</p>
        <p>A plain text description of the workflow is as follows:</p>
      </section>
      <ul className="bullet-points">
      <li><strong>Line 2:</strong> The event_queue is a list of possible transitions that can occur. It is seeded with new events every time someone transitions from Susceptible to Exposed. It is seeded for the first time when the user inputs initial infections in the parameters. The list of possible events include:
        <ul className="sub-list">
          <li>{'{EtoA, AtoT, AoR, AtoD, TtoI, TtoR, TtoD, ItoR, ItoD, CONTACT}'}</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Line 3-4:</strong> The next action taken depends on what type of event is pulled off the queue. </li>
      <li><strong>Line 5-6:</strong> If the event type is one of {'{EtoA, AtoT, AtoR, AtoD}'}, then:
        <ul className="sub-list">react fold content
          <li>The old compartment is decremented by one and the new compartment is incremented by one. For example, if the event is EtoA, then one individual is moved from the Exposed compartment into the Asymptomatic compartment. Then the event is removed from the queue.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Line 7-9:</strong> If the event type is one of {'{TtoI, TtoR, TtoD, ItoR, ItoD}'}, then:
        <ul className="sub-list">
          <li>A function called keep_event() is called that will return True or False based on a probabilistic check. If True, then the transition between compartments occurs. If False, then the transition does not occur, but a counter is incremented. As the number of skipped events increases, the likelihood of skipping an event decreases. Following either outcome (True or False), the event is discarded from the queue.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Line 10:</strong> The last type of event is a CONTACT event.</li>
      <li><strong>Line 11:</strong> A probabilistic check called keep_contact() is performed. If the check fails (False), a counter is incremented and increases the likelihood of the check passing (True) the next time.</li>
      <li><strong>Line 12-15:</strong> If the keep_contact() check returns True, then an individual is moved from Susceptible to Exposed. Next, a new Schedule object is instantiated with the current time. The Schedule object models the timing of transition of disease through the various compartments for that Exposed individual. The math (described below) uses some random number generation and information about the current population and disease parameters to determine which events will occur. Finally, the parameters of the Schedule object will seed new transition events and new contact events into the queue.</li>
    </ul>  

    

    <section className="text">


      <p>The main logic of the Stochastic SEATIRD model happens inside the Schedule object. Every time an individual is exposed (whether through user-defined initial infected OR through contact events), a new Schedule object is instantiated which defines the timing for all subsequent transitions for that individual. Given a time in units of simulation day, the Schedule object solves the following equations to determine transition time (T) to other compartments:</p>
     
     
     
      <p>Ta = rand_exp(tau) + now</p>
      <p>Tt = rand_exp(kappa) + Ta</p>
      <p>Ti = chi + Tt</p>
      <p>T{'d<=a'} = rand_exp(nu) + Ta</p>
      <p>T{'d=t,i'} = rand_exp(nu) + Tt</p>
      <p>T{'r<=a'} = rand_exp(gamma) + Ta</p>
      <p>T{'r<=t,i'} = rand_exp(gamma) + Tt</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>Where: </p> 

      <ul className="bullet-points">
          <li><strong>Ta</strong> is time from exposed to asymptomatic</li>
          <li><strong>Tt</strong> is time from asymptomatic to treatable</li>react fold content
          <li><strong>Ti</strong> is time from treatable to infectious</li>
          <li><strong>T{'d<=a'}</strong> is time from asymptomatic to deceased</li>
          <li><strong>T{'d=t,i'}</strong> is time from treatable/infectious to deceased</li>
          <li><strong>T{'r<=a'}</strong> is time from asymptomatic to recovered</li>
          <li><strong>T{'r<=t,i'}</strong> is time from treatable/infectious to recovered</li>
          <li><strong>now</strong> is the current day</li>
          <li><strong>tau</strong> is latency period in days</li>
          <li><strong>kappa</strong> is asymptomatic period in days</li>
          <li><strong>chi</strong> is treatable to infectious rate in days</li>
          <li><strong>nu</strong> is mortality rate</li>
          <li><strong>gamma</strong> is total infectious period in days</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The function called rand_exp() returns the negative log of a random value [0,1) divided by the provided value.</p>
      <p>The values of the different possible transition times determine the path that the individual will take through the compartments. For example, if T{'r<=i'} {'<'} T{'d<=i'}, then the individual will recover (not die) from the infectious period. The path through compartments will determine the identity of events that are seeded onto the event queue.</p>

        <p><strong>Travel Model</strong></p>
        <p>The current travel model implemented is a Binomial travel model. The travel() method is called from src/simulator.py at the end of each day – after the disease model simulation logic has been applied to each node. In the travel model, all pairwise node combinations are considered. “Sink” refers to the node where people travel to, “Source” refers to the node where people travel from.</p>

          <li><strong>Line 10: </strong>After counting the number of infectious contacts that occur across all age groups (inner iteration), divide that count by the total population of the node, multiply by the travel flow data, and add to the probabilities list.</li>

          <li><strong>Line 13: </strong>Calculate a probability of exposure based on the probabilities (for unvaccinated group) list and the vaccine_effectiveness list (for vaccinated group).</li>
          <li><strong>Line 14: </strong>Use a binomial expression given the total number of susceptible individuals on the sink node and the probability of exposure to calculate the number of individuals in the sink node that were exposed.</li>

       </ul>
       <p>The main objective of this model is to compute the number of individuals that were infected from travel in each age group in each node. Then, it calls the disease model to transition those individuals from Susceptible => Exposed. In the first step, it calculates the number of infectious contacts that occur for each age group as:</p>
       <p>NIC{'sink=>source'} = (Transmitting * beta * rho * contact_rate * sigma) / flow_reduction</p>
       <p>NIC{'source=>sink'} = (Asymptomatic * beta * rho * contact_rate * sigma) / flow_reduction</p>

        <ul className="bullet-points">
            <li><strong>NIC{'sink=>source'}</strong> is the number of infectious contacts that occur during travel from the sink node to the source nodes</li>
            <li><strong>NIC{'source=>sink'}</strong> is the number of infectious contacts that occur during travel from the source node to the sink node</li>

            <li><strong>flow_reduction</strong> is a parameter representing reduced travel for different age groups</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The model assumes that infectious contacts that occur to sink node individuals travelling to other nodes can occur from contact with any of the transmitting population in source nodes (asymptomatic, treatable, or infectious). On the other hand, the model assumes that treatable and infectious individuals from the source nodes are not themselves travelling. Only asymptomatic individuals from the source nodes can travel to the sink node and create infectious contacts. After enumerating all of the infectious contacts that occur for each age group on the sink node, the probability of transmission for each age group is computed as:</p>
        <p>Prob = ((Flowsink=>source * NICsink=>source) / TotalPopulationsink) + 
                         ((Flowsource=>sink * NICsource=>sink) / TotalPopulationsource)</p>
